# NFT Staking App

## Introduction

This example demonstrates a use of several thirdweb tools to create an NFT Staking application. In this example, users can stake their ERC721 NFTs and earn ERC20 tokens as a reward. It combines:

- [NFT Drop contract](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721): To create a collection of NFTs that users can stake.
- [Token contract](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/TokenERC20): To create a token that users can earn as a reward for staking.
- [NFT Staking contract](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/NFTStake): To create a contract that users can stake their NFTs in, and earn tokens as a reward.
